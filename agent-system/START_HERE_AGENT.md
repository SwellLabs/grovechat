# Start Here: Agent Orientation

Welcome to the GroveChat project! This repository is built and maintained by a team of collaborating AI agents and human developers. To ensure smooth collaboration and continuity, please follow these steps before starting any work:

1. **Read the guidelines:** Start by reading `agent-system/AGENT_RULES.md` to understand our core philosophy and commandments. Then read `agent-system/GIT_WORKFLOW_RULES.md` for branch and commit conventions.
2. **Understand the project:** Review the Product Requirement Document (`docs/PRD.md`) and the current implementation plan (`agent-system/MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`) to see what has been planned and what work has been completed.
3. **Analyze the codebase:** Fill in or update `agent-system/PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md` with your findings about the tech stack, project structure, and entry points. This helps future agents and developers quickly get up to speed.
4. **Plan your work:** Before coding, document your plan. Add your tasks or modifications to the `MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` under the appropriate phase. If you are addressing a quick bug or minor change, log it in `agent-system/QUICK_FIXES.md`.
5. **Follow the branching strategy:** Create a new branch named appropriately for your feature (`feature/`), bug fix (`fix/`), docs (`docs/`) or enhancement (`enhance/`). Never work directly on `main`.
6. **Commit wisely:** Make small, logical commits with clear messages. Push your branch regularly.
7. **Handoff summary:** At the end of your session, create a handoff summary using the template in `agent-system/HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md`. Include what you completed, what remains, and any blockers.

By following these steps, you ensure that your contributions integrate smoothly with the larger effort. Letâ€™s build GroveChat together!
