# GroveChat iOS and watchOS Project

This directory contains the source code for the GroveChat mobile and watch apps. It is structured to support both an iOS companion app (for parents) and a watchOS app (for children). The current skeleton is minimal and will be expanded by future agents.

## Structure

```
ios/
├── WatchApp/
│  ├── WatchApp.swift      – Entry point for the watchOS app
│  └── ContentView.swift   – Simple SwiftUI view showing placeholder text
└── (future directories for iOS companion app)
```

## Building

To build the watch app:

1. Open the Xcode workspace (to be added later) or open the `WatchApp` folder in Xcode.
2. Ensure you are using the latest version of Xcode with watchOS SDK.
3. Select the WatchApp scheme and run on the simulator or an actual watch device.

The iOS companion app and backend code will be added in subsequent iterations.
